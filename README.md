Autonomous Car  
A battery powered car. The car will be able to follow lane/road with marking. It will use camera to find the path angle and run over the path.

## Hardware: 
    parts list: [N.B.: unit prices are approximate]
        - Raspberry Pi 3B+ (1pc)  (4500tk)  
        - Pi camera (1pc)         (2000tk)
        - 90 degree angled small plastic gear motor (2pc)  (60tk)
        - Wheel Caster (1pc)      (90tk)
        - Plastic wheel (2pc)     (60tk)
        - L293d Motor Driver IC (1pc)                       (40tk)
        - Double battery holder for 18650 (2pc)             (40tk)
        - Mini breadboard (1pc)                             (60tk)
        

## Software:
Without machine Learning there are two methods for lane detection:  
    - Histogram method
    - Canny-Hough Line detection
    
Various tutorials are being collected and tested.

In histogram directory, 
    - The very first one uses simple code. But it has no details or description. Also uses python2. So can not be used by a beginner. When I will have more expertise, then debug it.
    
    - The Second one(Murtaza tutorial) is detailed and has video description. Working on it.
